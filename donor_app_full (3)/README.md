## 🛠️ Development

### Training New Models

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Donor_Availability_Predictor.ipynb
```

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model comparison and selection
- Model saving and evaluation

### App Structure

- **app.py**: Main Streamlit application with prediction logic
- **pages/**: Authentication pages for multi-page app
- **Authentication**: File-based user management with password hashing

## 📈 Features Engineering

The model uses various engineered features:
- **Basic Features**: City, blood group, donation history
- **Time Features**: Year, month, day components
- **Enhanced Features**: Donation frequency, commitment scores, availability indicators

## 🔐 Security

- Password hashing using PBKDF2
- Session-based authentication
- File-based user storage (not for production)
